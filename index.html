                <p id="firstp">Her videos usually discuss a particular topic through a context of philosophy from a left-leaning perspective. Though her videos often have a format similar to that of a lecture or a blog, they can often take on a more stylized nature featuring dramatized cutaway scenes to illustrate her points.</p>
                <p id="secondp">St. James described the video Men. Abuse. Trauma. as "one of the best TV episodes of the year".Thorn's video Queer✨ was one of 134 video essays included in Sight and Sound as one of the "best video essays of 2019". Strucci reviewed for the magazine that the video was "illuminating and entertaining" as well as "joyful". Gwendolyn Ann Smith, writing for the Bay Area Reporter, praised Identity: A Trans Coming Out Story as "delving deeply into the very nature of being trans in ways she has not typically seen", in relation to the perspective that gender transitioning is about "revealing the truth within" rather than "becoming something that we weren't".</p>
